## About me
Hello All,

I'm Heer.

My name is Heer and pursing my Bachelorâ€™s Degree from Charotar University of Science and Technology and currently studying in Third year. I love eating chocolates.

So on that note let me share with you guys one sweet poem on chocolates:

- *Chocolate is sweet*</br> 
- *and so good to eat.*</br>
- *I like it whenever*</br>
- *I need a good treat.*</br>


- *In brownies and cookies*</br>
- *and chocolate cake,*</br>
- *it adds extra sweetness*</br>
- *to everything you bake.*</br>

- *White chocolate. dark chocolate*</br>
-  *and milk chocolate galore,*</br> 
- *I know I could eat 100 pieces or more!*</br>
- *That is for sure ;)*


Thank You
