# Whoami

We all get confused a lot when we start contributing to open-source that how
this thing works. To make whole open-source contribution thing easy for beginners to understand
Club Gamma has introduced this new concept in which open-source contribution is simplified.
Basically this project will give you the feel of how contribution to big open-source projects works.

This repo contains the source code of : https://clubgamma.github.io/Whoami/public/

## But what contributors need to contribute

Your creativity, all we want from you is small intro of yours and some creative stuff from your side
which you find fascinating and want to share it with the world.
